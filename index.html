		<div>We are building a platform where museums and sponsors alike can be successful in delivering advertisements with the same level of engagement and professionalism our audience expects.</div>
		<div>Appealing

		<div>Reach an Effective

		<div>Ready to Promote Your Business?</div>
		<div>Let’s face it – most users hate advertisements. Advertisements are getting more pervasive, obnoxious, and intrusive. On computers and smartphones, adblockers are increasingly being installed to bypass advertisements. </div>
		<div>The truth is, we hate bad advertisements too. As a solution to this challenge, Museas has developed a strategy that aims to undue this negative perception. Our approach is to collaborate with sponsors to create advertisements that users will enjoy, without feeling tracked or targeted. </div>

		<div>Japanese
Pagoda</div>
		<div>3D AR Pagoda 
With digitization, Museas helps museums transform their content into virtual formats lasting for as long as computers exist.</div>
		<div>The stupa was originally a simple mound containing the Buddha's ashes which in time became more elaborate, while its finial grew proportionally larger. After reaching China, the stupa met the Chinese watchtower and evolved into the pagoda, a tower with an odd number of storeys. Its use then spread to Korea and, from there, to Japan. Following its arrival in Japan together with Buddhism in the 6th century, the pagoda became one of the focal points of the early Japanese garan. In Japan it evolved in shape, size and function, finally losing its original role as a reliquary It also became extremely common, while on the Asian continent it is rare.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>History
</div>
		<div>Tiered towers with many roofs, pagodas are synonymous with gardens, culture and architecture. Originating from ancient Indian stupas or ceremonial burial mounds, Japanese ones are almost all built from wood and have much larger roof overhangs.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Pagodas in Japan are called tō (塔 lit. pagoda), sometimes buttō (仏塔 lit. Buddhist pagoda) or tōba (塔婆 lit. pagoda) and historically derive from the Chinese pagoda, itself an interpretation of the Indian stupa.</div>
